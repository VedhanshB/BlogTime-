        <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the
          entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on
          the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the
          servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring
          celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there
          is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi
          theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <p class="text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter
        to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a
        historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of diffe
        rent devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history
        . It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We
        had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments
        built around 300 years ago</p>

      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I had visited at June 16</h5>
      <p class="text-muted text-left">The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') constructed in 1591, is a monu
        ment and mosque located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The landmark has become known globally as a symbol of
        Hyderabad and is listed among the most recognised structures in India. It has also been officially incorporated
        as the Emblem of Telangana for the state of Telangana. The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a
        mosque on its top floor for more than 400 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also
        known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most
        frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site
        of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr.</p>

          <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal 
            previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack Panther Age of Ant Man and the Was Problem is that the whole movie i
            s homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at
             the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

          <p>HAKUNA MATATA.... I really loved this song... 
            I haven’t had the fortune of watching the 1994 original The Lion King or the 2012 3D re-release in
             theaters, but I still remember watching the it on Television after it was digitally re-mastered. From then on, it has been on my top favourite list. I have watched the movie again and again and still cherish the experience. </p>

          <p>I have to say I didn't read the comics, however out of all the
             superhero films this one felt the most balanced. It has everything you could ask for
              in a superhero film such as real life struggles. They really make you feel the struggle
               Peter has trying to keep saving the world and enjoy his youth. Also they really 
               nail the villian in both of these new Spiderman films. Mysterio is sooooo amazing It 
               made me wish he could have been the new replacement for ironman but like most movies 
               there is the twist. Even with the twist he is such a layered character. I also loved 
               how it goes so well with endgame. It's like pairing a great wine with a great meal.
                It does great at giving what fans needed a breath and chance to mourn our fan favorites
                 that didn't make it. The use of imagery in alot of scenes of a character lost really 
                 helps make spiderman and the audience aware of the shoes he is trying to fill and the 
                 shadow of it. But it also makes you realize he is only 16 to have all this responsibility
                  is insane. The love scenes are awesome they suit a young first love awkwardness. Instead
                   of Frenching they peck and look petrified which is perfect. Also I applaud Zendaya as MJ
                   she is the right fit. She brings something new not over the top but just right for 
                   a independent and intelligent love interest who looks like she can hold her own. 
                   This is how the mcu gets things right not only is there a layered plot and great
                   comic faithful characters but they also leaving hints to connect other films
                    and do twists that make sense and we should have spotted but missed it so you 
                    want to go back and say oh wow they filled me happily. I just hope they keep this
                     highschool grounded aspect for future Spiderman films it gives him more of a 
                     deep and relatable aspect. I mean noone wants to see the same spiderman story
                     over and over again and please don't bring back green goblin again for a film. 
                     I mean the vulture wasn't as big of a villian as some are and look at how well 
                     done he was. Sometimes new and simple are best. I am just hopeful they can live 
                     up to the bar set for themselves with this new great entry. But if this is the futu
                     re being set up for the MCU then I am excited to see what's to come. To summarize it's a must see movie.
                      If you miss it in theaters you will regret it. It's great on the big screen. 5/5 great plot, great 
                      characters, great twists, great dialogue........so amazing I can't stop thinking about it. </p>
